Wave-Simulator-Beta
===================

This is some honestly terrible code that I wrote way back before I knew anything about proper coding practices, the UI is awful but the simulations done in Matlab are actually pretty good. The program contains two simulators, one for 2D waves and one for 3D waves. You will be able to choose the initial conditions of multiple waves and watch them interact through time and space.
